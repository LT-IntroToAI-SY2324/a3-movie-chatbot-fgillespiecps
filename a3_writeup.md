# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
This function takes the user input and searches the database for the next action.

You could create a chatbot that for sports. You can have years, games, players, coaches that the chatbot could search through.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
The most difficult part of the assignment was understanding the code. Learning about the new functions and its uses to implement into the group project was challenging.
